      <div><section data-level="h1"><h1>Course   VM  Setup</h1><p>Each student is being given a virtual machine which is dedicated to this
course.  You may use it for any activities relevant to this course or
your CS interests.
</p><p>Note that you will have exclusive access to this VM via its IP address
which will typically start with <code>128.226</code>.  All programming work for
this course <strong>must</strong> be done on your VM.  <strong>Do not attempt to use
remote.cs</strong>; it will not work as the software installed there is
out-of-date.
</p><p>The VM can only be accessed using ssh from <strong>within</strong> the campus
network accessed using the campus VPN.
</p><p>The VM runs Ubuntu 24.04.  Software which will be required by the
course is  <a href="./setup.sh?lang=sh">pre-installed,</a> but it is possible that you may
need to install additional software during the course of the semester.
</p><p>You should make sure that you perform each of the following steps:
</p><ol><li><p> <a href="#pw-change">Initial password change</a>.
</p></li><li><p> <a href="#no-pw-ssh">SSH Access Without Using a Password</a>.
</p></li><li><p> <a href="#x2go-access">X2Go access to your VM</a>.
</p></li><li><p> <a href="#npm-sh">Set up a npm shell</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Set up necessary git repositories on your
    VM; this is detailed in a  <a href="./git-setup.html">separate document</a>.
</p></li></ol><p>[This document uses the term &quot;workstation &quot; to refer to the computer
to which your keyboard and mouse are attached to.]
</p><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="pw-change">Initial</span> Password Change</h2><p>You should have received an email giving you the IP
address <code>VM-IP</code> of your VM, your login id <code>VM-LOGIN-ID</code> and your initial
password <code>VM-PW</code>.  Since your password has been exposed in an unsecure
email, it <strong>must be changed</strong> ASAP.  Hence you should <strong>immediately</strong>
login to your VM and change your password to some <code>VM-NEW-PW</code> of your
choosing.
</p><ol><li><p>Ensure that your workstation is connected to the campus network,
    possibly using the
    
    <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/its/about/teams/operations-infrastructure/network_administration/connecting_from_off_campus-ssl-vpn/index.html">campus VPN</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Use ssh to connect to your VM using the provided IP address
    <code>VM-IP</code>, <code>VM-LOGIN-ID</code> and initial password <code>VM-PW</code>.
</p><p>    If your workstation runs Linux or OS/X, you can do so using a
    command-line <code>ssh</code> client.  If your workstation runs Windows, you
    can use
    
    <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/get-started">Windows Terminal</a> from the MS store.  There is even an
    
    <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/iodihamcpbpeioajjeobimgagajmlibd?hl=en">ssh app</a> which you can install for your Chrome browser; this
    should work for all OS's which support Chrome.
</p><p>    [It may be the case that your VM has a name starting with a course
    number different from the course you are registered for; it was
    set up this way for the convenience of the sysadmin and should not
    make any difference to you.]
</p></li><li><p>Use the <code>passwd</code> command on your VM, to change your password
    to <code>VM-NEW-PW</code>.
</p></li></ol><p>Once you have logged in to the campus VPN as in (1) above, the
following log shows how you would perform steps (2) and (3):
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh"># from a linux or os/x terminal (windows will differ).
$ ssh VM-LOGIN-ID@VM-IP
The authenticity of host 'VM-IP (VM-IP)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is ...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'VM-IP' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
VM-LOGIN-ID@VM-IP's password: VM-PW   #will not be echoed
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04 ...
...
# at this point you should be connected to your VM.

</pre></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="no-pw-ssh">SSH</span> Access Without Using a Password</h2><p>If your workstation does not already have a public/private ssh keys
set up, generate one using the method appropriate for your workstation's
OS and then copy over the public key to your VM.
</p><p>On a unix-based OS like linux or OS/X this can be done using
 <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html">ssh-keygen</a>
to generate the public/private keypair and then using

<a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/ssh-copy-id.1.html">ssh-copy-id</a> to copy your public key to your workstation.
</p><p>Verify that you can ssh from your workstation to your VM without
needing to type your password.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="x2go-access">X2Go</span> Access to your VM</h2><p>If you only use <code>ssh</code>, you obtain only basic command-line access to
your VM.  But you will need GUI access to your VM as the course
progresses and are required to verify that you have set up GUI access
in your submission for <em>Project 1</em>.  The most convenient access is
provided by x2go.  (The end of this document lists some alternatives
in case you just cannot get x2go to work.)
</p><ol><li><p>Install a
     <a href="https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start">X2Go client</a> for
    the workstation you are using to access your VM if one is not
    already installed (note that a <code>x2goclient</code> command is available
    on <code>remote.cs</code>).
</p></li><li><p>Start the <code>x2goclient</code>.
</p></li><li><p>Create a session for connecting to your VM by clicking <em>Session</em>
    -> <em>New session</em>.  Fill in the following fields:
</p><dl><dt>Session name</dt><dd><p>          <code>webprog vm</code>
</p></dd><dt>Host</dt><dd><p>         Your VM's IP address <code>VM-IP</code>
</p></dd><dt>Login</dt><dd><p>         Your login id <code>VM-LOGIN-ID</code> on your VM (if different from your
	 login id on your workstation).
</p></dd><dt> Auto Login </dt><dd><p>         Select <em>Try auto login (via SSH Agent or default SSH key)</em>
	 (this assumes that you have correctly set up password-less
	 login from your workstation to your VM).
</p></dd><dt>Session type</dt><dd><p>         <code>LXDE</code> or <code>XFCE</code>.
</p></dd></dl></li><li><p>You should now be able to use the above session to access your VM
    using a GUI.  You should not require a password if you have set up
    the ssh keys correctly.
</p></li></ol><p>The following is a screenshot of my <code>x2go</code> configuration for accessing
my VM from within the campus network (or VPN):
</p><p><img src="webprog-x2go-config.png">
</p><p>With the above setup, I do not need to type in a password when
connecting to my VM.
</p><p>When disconnecting from x2go, use the <strong>Suspend</strong> control (the widget
which looks like a <em>pause</em> control, with two lines) on the blue x2go
window. This will ensure that you can pick up where you left off when
you reconnect to your VM.  <strong>Do not shutdown</strong> your VM (you will need to
restart it manually using the  <a href="#vsphere">VSphere Web Client</a> if you
do so).
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="npm-sh">Setting</span> Your npm Shell</h2><p>To set the shell used by npm to bash, use the following command:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">$ npm config set script-shell /usr/bin/bash
</pre><p>This will update your <code>~/.npmrc</code> and npm will use bash to run scripts in
the future.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="restart">Restarting</span> your VM</h2><p>In case you accidentally shutdown your VM or simply find it
unreachable, you can use your VM's web console to restart it.
</p><ol><li><p>Use all except the last step in the instructions for the 
     <a href="#vsphere">vSphere Web Client</a> to get access to your VM.
</p></li><li><p>Use the <code>Actions->Power</code> menu item to restart your VM.
</p></li></ol></section><section data-level="h2"><h2> <span id="debug">Debugging</span> VM Connectivity Issues</h2><p>If you cannot connect via x2go to your VM, please try the
following:
</p><ol><li><p>Verify that your workstation's internet connection is working by
    accessing some web site not related to the university.
</p></li><li><p>Connect your workstation to the campus VPN.
</p></li><li><p>Use ssh to connect to <code>remote.cs</code>. If you are unable to do so, go
    to the  <a href="https://www2.cs.binghamton.edu/~sysadmin/">CS SysAdmin</a>
    page for assistance.
</p></li><li><p>From <code>remote.cs</code>, ssh to your VM using its IP address.  If this
    succeeds, then there is a problem with x2go.  If this fails, then
    your VM is down;  <a href="#restart">restart</a> it using the 
    <a href="#vsphere">vsphere</a> web client.
</p></li><li><p>If the problem appears to be x2go, try shutting down your
    x2goserver using the power button on your x2goclient or
    by restarting your VM as per the previous step.
</p><p>    Some students using OS/X workstations have found that:
</p><ol><li><p>Rebooting your mac may help.
</p></li><li><p>More drastic: <strong>Reinstalling</strong> x2go and xquartz solves x2go problems.
</p></li></ol></li><li><p>One workaround for OS/X.  If you have xquartz installed, but x2go
    is not installed or not working, you can display GUI applications
    running on <code>remote.cs</code> on your mac by using the <code>-Y</code> option when
    connecting to <code>remote.cs</code> using your OS/X terminal.
</p></li></ol><p>If all else fails, please send me an email giving your VM's IP
and describe your workstation's environment.  Please
<strong>detail the responses to each of the above steps</strong>.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Administering Your VM</h2><p>Your vm account has administrative privileges.  You can run any
administrative CLI command by preceeding that command by <code>sudo</code> at
which point you will be prompted for your current password.  
If you run an administrative task using the GUI, you will again be
prompted for your current VM password.
</p><p>You will find that the VM has two additional accounts in addition to
your account.  You should <strong>not</strong> touch those accounts.  If something
goes wrong with your VM, we may be able to use these accounts to login
to your VM and attempt to fix the problem.
</p><p>You can install additional system-wide software packages using the
command line using  <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/apt">apt</a> or using a
GUI-program found on the system menu.  In particular, <code>sudo apt
install</code> <em>PACKAGE</em> can be used to install a <em>PACKAGE</em> from the Ubuntu
package repository.
</p><p>The VM has text editors/IDEs like Visual Studio <code>code</code>, <code>emacs</code>,
<code>gedit</code>, <code>nano</code>, <code>sublime</code> and <code>vim</code> already installed.  However, you
may want to use the above package manager to install a text editor or
IDE of your choice.
</p><p>It is a good idea to keep the software on your VM up-to-date.  Every
few weeks, you should update it:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
</pre><p>Check whether you need to reboot:
</p><pre>$ cat /var/run/reboot-required
</pre><p>If this file exists, the above command will tell you whether a reboot
is required.  To reboot, first backup all work, shutdown all applications
running within your VM and then simply reboot:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">$ sudo shutdown -r now
</pre><p>Your GUI session will lock up.  You will need to escape out of it; you
should be able to get back in within a couple of minutes.  If something
goes wrong please use the  <a href="#vsphere">vsphere console</a> to debug.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Other Remote Access Methods</h2><p>If, for some reason, you just cannot get x2go to connect to your VM,
you can try using one of these other methods of obtaining GUI access
to your VM.
</p><section data-level="h3"><h3>VNC Access</h3><p>  <a id="vnc-access" href="https://www.tightvnc.com/">VNC</a> allows remote access to
graphical desktops.  It is not as efficient as x2go which is optimized
for X11, but has the advantage that it can be used to access non-X11
desktops like a Windows desktop.
</p><ol><li><p>Connect to your VM using <code>ssh</code>.
</p></li><li><p>Use an editor on your VM to create a script 
    <a href="./vnc-xstartup">~/.vnc/xstartup</a> to start <code>lxde</code>.  Make it executable using <code>chmod
    a+x ~/.vnc/xstartup</code>.
</p></li><li><p>Start up a VNC server on your VM.
</p><ol><li><p>Run <code>vncpasswd</code> to set up a password <code>VNC-PW</code> for your VNC
         sessions.
</p></li><li><p>Run <code>vncserver</code> to start up the VNC server.  Note the VNC
         port <code>VNC-PORT</code> on which the server starts (usually 1).
</p></li></ol></li><li><p>Install a VNC viewer for the workstation you are using to access
    your VM if one is not already installed.
</p></li><li><p>Run the VNC viewer to connect to <code>VM-IP:VNC-PORT</code>.  Provide your
    VNC password <code>VNC-PW</code> when prompted.  You should see your desktop.
</p></li></ol><p>You can kill your vnc server using <code>vncserver -kill :VNC-PORT</code>.  If
you would like to set a size for its window, specify the <code>-geometry</code>
argument.  See the  <a href="https://www.tightvnc.com/vncserver.1.php">man page</a>
for more information.
</p></section><section data-level="h3"><h3>Xming X Server for Windows</h3><p>Instead of running a full remote session, you can run a X11 server on
your Windows workstation.
 <a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/">xming</a> appears to be a
popular X11 server running under Window.  Apparently,
 <a href="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/IDH_DISPLAY.htm">xlaunch</a>
is a wizard for starting xming sessions.  Since I do not use Windows,
I have not tried this and YMMV.
</p></section><section data-level="h3"><h3> <span id="vsphere">vSphere</span> Web Client</h3><ol><li><p>Go to this URL:  <a href="http://csvb-vc.binghamton.edu">&lt;http://csvb-vc.binghamton.edu></a>.  (this <strong>must</strong>
    be done from within the campus network).
</p></li><li><p>Click through the security warnings and click the <strong>LAUNCH VSPHERE
    CLIENT</strong> button.
</p></li><li><p>Login with your regular BU username and password.
    Enter <code>BU\</code> before your username.  Do not check the
    <em>Use Windows session authentication</em> checkbox.
</p></li><li><p>On the left-hand side of the interface you can expand the
    tree. Keep expanding the levels until you see a VM whose name is based
    on your user ID.  You should see a summary of your VM.
</p></li><li><p>Use the provided link to open a <strong>web console</strong> to the VM which will
    allow you to interact with it as if you were sitting in front of
    it using a console which runs within your web browser.
</p></li></ol><p>Note that unlike the x2go or vnc options, the vSphere web client will
not persist your session on your VM.
