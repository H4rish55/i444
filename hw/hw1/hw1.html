<strong>Max Points</strong>: 100
</p><p><strong>Important Reminders</strong>:
</p><ul><li><p>As per the course
    
    <a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy.html">Academic Honesty Statement</a>, cheating of any kind will minimally
    result in your letter grade for the entire course being reduced by
    one level.
</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>If any use of AI is detected, you will receive a <strong>zero</strong> for the
    entire assignment.
</p></li></ul><p><strong>Justify all answers.</strong>
</p><p><strong>It may be the case that some questions cannot be answered as
 requested.</strong>
</p><p>Note that some of the questions require you to show code.  You may use
a JavaScript implementation to verify your answers.
</p><p>You are encouraged to use the web or the library but are <strong>required</strong> to
cite any external sources used in your answers.
</p><p>Many of the questions are meant to familiarize you with the built-in
functions available in JavaScript (and many other languages) for
arrays and strings. 
</p><p>To be turned in using <strong>two</strong> submission links on gradescope:
</p><dl><dt> Homework 1 PDF </dt><dd><p>    This link requires you to upload a <strong>single PDF</strong> containing
    the answers to the first five questions in this document.
    You will then need to indicate the page within your upload
    where your answer to each question is located.
</p></dd><dt> Homework 1 Zip </dt><dd><p>    This link requires you to upload a single zip file which when
    unpacked <strong>must</strong> create a <code>hw1-sol</code> directory containing
    the following files:
</p><dl><dt> <code>hw1-sol/hw1-sol.ts</code> </dt><dd><p>       This TypeScript file must contain runnable code for 11
       functions.  The provided  <a href="hw1-sol">hw1-sol</a> directory contains
       a  <a href="hw1-sol/hw1-sol.ts?lang=ts">skeleton starter file</a>
       which provides the specifications for the required functions,
       as well as a  <a href="hw1-sol/hw1-tests.ts?lang=ts">tests file</a>
       which can be used to clear up any ambiguities in the
       specifications.
</p></dd></dl></dd></dl><ol><li><p>JavaScript's <code>Array</code> class supports a  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice">splice()</a>
    method which reverses an array in place.  Why is there no similar
    method for the <code>String</code> class? <em>6-points</em>
</p></li><li><p>A Java programmer is attempting to use JavaScript to validate
    a <code>user</code> object:
</p><pre class="hljs language-javascript">    if (user.id == null) {
      //report error that id field is not defined
    }
</pre><p>    What is wrong with this code?  Provide a better replacement:
    <em>6-points</em>
</p></li><li><p>Given a vocabulary \(\Sigma\) containing 2 symbols <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>,
    give regex's for the following: <em>10-points</em>
</p><ol><li><p>All non-empty strings over \(\Sigma\) which have length less
        than 10.
</p></li><li><p>All strings over \(\Sigma\) which have length less than 20 and
        end with a <code>1</code>.
</p></li><li><p>All strings of length 4 over \(\Sigma\) which are palindromes.
</p></li><li><p>All non-empty strings over \(\Sigma\) which are palindromes.
</p></li><li><p>All non-empty strings over \(\Sigma\) which are even, when
        interpreted as a binary number.
</p></li></ol></li><li><p>In  <a href="../../projects/prj1/prj1.html">Project 1</a>:
</p><ol><li><p>The
        
        <a href="../../projects/prj1/prj1-sol/src/lib/chat-types.ts?lang=ts#:~:text=type%20User%20%3d">User</a> type contains a separate <code>id</code> property even though both
        <code>email</code> and <code>chatName</code> are documented as unique and could also
        be used to uniquely identify a user.  What are the advantages
        of such a design? <em>8-points</em>
</p></li><li><p>The entities represent timestamps using UTC time.  What are
        the advantages and disadvantages of this choice? <em>8-points</em>
</p></li></ol></li><li><p>You are working for an evil spammer who requires you to scrape
    web pages looking for US phone numbers.  For each discovered
    phone number, you are required to automatically classify how
    likely it is to really be a phone number into 3 categories:
    <code>low</code>, <code>medium</code> and <code>high</code>.  Discuss how you would
    proceed using the technologies discussed so far in this course.
</p><p>    Your answer should be specific showing code or pseudo-code
    fragments.
</p><p>    You need not consider how the web pages are fetched from web
    sites.  You should assume that you have HTML text available
    locally and you have to extract possible phone numbers from that
    text. <em>15-points</em>
</p></li><li><p>Implement the 11 functions specified in
     <a href="./hw1-sol/hw1-sol.ts?lang=ts">hw1-sol.ts</a> subject to
     <a href="restrictions.html">these restrictions</a>.  To start with, copy
    the  <a href="hw1-sol">hw1-sol</a> directory to your <code>submit</code> folder on your VM.
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ cd ~/cs444
    $ git pull
    $ cd ~/i444/submit	   # go to clone of github repo
    $ git pull             # pull in any updates
    $ cp -r ~/cs444/hw/hw1/hw1-sol .  #copy initial files
    $ cd hw1-sol           # go to copied dir
    $ git add .            # add copied files to git
    $ git commit -m 'started hw1 fns'
    $ git push             # push to github
</pre><p>    Implement the specified functions.  As each function is implemented,
    activate its tests in  <a href="hw1-sol/hw1-tests.ts?lang=ts">hw1-tests.ts</a>
    by uncommenting the corresponding part of <code>FN_TESTS</code>.  You can
    run the tests verbosely by running <code>hw1-tests.ts</code> with one-or-more
    arguments as in <code>./hw1-tests-ts -v</code>.
</p><p>    When completed, the above command should result in all tests
    passing as in this linked  <a href="LOG">LOG.</a>
</p><p>    Running <code>hw1-tests.ts</code> without any arguments should result in
    empty output when all activated tests pass.
</p><p>    To submit, zip your entire <code>hw1-sol</code> directory:
</p><pre class="hljs language-sh">    $ cd ~/i444/submit	   # go to clone of github repo
    $ ~/cs444/bin/do-zip.sh hw1-sol
</pre><p>    and submit the resulting zip-file using the <strong>Homework 1 Zip</strong>
    submission link on gradescope.
