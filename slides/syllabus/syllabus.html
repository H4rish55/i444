    that your contribution was accepted.
</p></li><li><p>The contribution must be made <strong>during this semester</strong> and <strong>before the
    last week of class</strong>.
</p></li></ul><p>Extra credit may also be awarded to students who submit work which
went way beyond what was expected.  This will be initiated by us; if
you ask for it, you probably do not qualify.
</p></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Attendance</h2><ul><li><p>During some random classes, I will take attendance of some
    random selection of students.  This may be done multiple
    times within a single class.

    in the semester.

    <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs444@binghamton.edu">send me an email</a> <strong>before class</strong>
    giving me a reason for the absence.  I may require documentation
    for the reason.  
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Assignment of Final Letter Grades</h2><ul><li><p>Letter grades will be assigned strictly monotonically based on
      the numeric course grade.
</p></li><li><p>No fixed cutoffs: they will be determined jointly by myself and
      the TA.
</p></li><li><p>The cutoffs will not be published.  This avoids issues caused by
      some students attempting to game the system by requesting
      regrading if they feel they just missed a cutoff.
</p></li><li><p>A letter grade of A will be only be given for consistent
      superior work.
</p></li><li><p>You will get an F only if you miss turning in a lot of work
      or submit consistently very poor quality work.
</p></li><li><p>If you have an issue with the grading of a particular assignment, it
      is <strong>imperative</strong> that you see the TA before the final exam.
</p></li><li><p>All assigned letter grades are final unless there is some kind
      of clerical error.  <strong>Do not send emails</strong> requesting a different
      letter grade unless there has been a clerical error.
</p></li><li><p>Details for 
      <a href="../../misc/course-grading/course-grading.html">Course Grading</a> are available.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Academic Honesty</h2><p>  As per the course
  
  <a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-policy.html">Academic Honesty Policy</a> cheating of any type will be penalized
  heavily.
</p><ul><li><p>Minimal penalty: zero on assignment and letter grade dropped by
      one slot: i.e. an A becomes an A-, a B- becomes a C+, etc.  You
      will also need to sign a Watson College document which will be
      added to your file.
</p></li><li><p>Permissible to collaborate to understand course material,
      homework questions or project assignments. <strong>Not permissible to
      discuss solutions.</strong>
</p><ul><li><p>If you feel you may have inadvertently crossed the line, then
        let us know; will not be considered cheating.
</p></li><li><p>If submitting an assignment late after the solution has been
        posted, you should obviously not be looking at the solution.
</p></li></ul></li><li><p>All registered students must sign and complete an
      
      <a href="../../misc/academic-honesty/academic-honesty-statement.html">Academic Honesty Statement.</a>
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Use of AI Tools</h2><ul><li><p>AI tools are not allowed to be used for completing any assignments
    in this course.
</p></li><li><p>If the use of AI tools is detected, then you will receive
    a <strong>zero</strong> on the assignment.
</p></li><li><p>If you use AI tools, use them to only supplement your understanding.
</p></li><li><p>Since AI tools can produce incorrect or suboptimal results, it is
    not a good idea to use them when you are not familiar with the
    material.
</p></li><li><p>It will not be possible to use AI tools during the midterm and
    final since the use of electronic devices is not permitted.  Hence
    you will need to understand the material in order to obtain a
    decent grade.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Late Submission Policy</h2><ul><li><p>You are allowed to submit projects and homework late by up to 3
    days with no penalty.
</p></li><li><p>You may not use more than 7 penalty-free late days over all
    assignments over the entire semester.
</p></li><li><p>Exceeding these limits will result in a substantial penalty: 20 points
    for each extra day.
</p></li><li><p>A day will count as 24 hours, irrespective of holidays or
    weekends.
</p></li><li><p>Late submissions will not be accepted for some assignments,
    especially before the midterm or towards the end of the
    semester.

      subscribed to the course mailing list at
       <a href="mailto:cs-444@binghamton.edu">cs-444@binghamton.edu</a>.
</p></li><li><p>Feel free to use the mailing list for general discussion/questions
      relevant to the course.
</p></li><li><p><strong>DO NOT</strong> use the mailing list to send emails to me specific to
      your personal situation.  Use
      
      <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs444@binghamton.edu">umrigar+cs444@binghamton.edu</a> instead.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>   <span id="personal-emails">Personal</span> Emails</h2><ul><li><p>Please  <a href="mailto:umrigar+cs444@binghamton.edu">email me</a> if you
    have a non-technical personal situation.
</p></li><li><p>If emailing the TA re. a grading issue, please CC me.
</p></li><li><p>For technical questions, please email both me and the course TA.
</p><ul><li><p>Be as specific as possible in your question.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not send screenshots of code</strong>.  Doing so makes it
       impossible to cut-and-paste the code.  Instead, include your
       code as <strong>text</strong> within your email.
</p></li><li><p>Do not send code for an entire project or function.  Instead,
       create a
       
       <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example">minimal reproducible example</a> which demonstrates the problem
       you are facing.  In my experience, attempting to create such an
       example will often result in your resolving the problem without
       any assistance.
</p></li></ul></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Classes</h2><ul><li><p>You are not allowed to use personal electronic devices like
    laptops or cell-phones during lectures (you must however bring a
    laptop to class in order to take pop quizzes).

    weather, the class will be held at the regular time on
     <a href="https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/umrigar">zoom.</a>
</p></li><li><p>If you are feeling unwell, you should not attend class.
</p></li><li><p>In the event that you are unable to attend class, you should
    inform me <strong>before</strong> the class.  If you have a valid excuse and
    there is a pop quiz, you will be allowed to make up the quiz.
</p></li><li><p>Multiple absences will require documentation.
</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>To accomodate students having excused absences, all classes
    will be streamed on  <a href="https://binghamton.zoom.us/my/umrigar">zoom.</a>
</p></li><li><p>Links to recordings of the zoom sessions will be made available on
    the course website in  <a href="../../misc/videos">misc/videos.</a>
</p></li><li><p>Please feel free to remind me if I start a class without starting
    the zoom recording.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Virtual Machines</h2><ul><li><p>Once course enrollments have stabilized, each student will be
    assigned a Linux-based virtual machine which can be used for
    course projects and other related work.
</p></li><li><p>Each VM comes preinstalled with all the software needed for the
    course. If you prefer to use your own computing environment, an
     <a href="../../misc/vm-setup/setup.sh?lang=shell">installation script</a>
    available. <strong>However, it is your responsibility to ensure that
    submitted code runs within your VM environment</strong>.
</p></li><li><p>The first project will require you to install additional software within
    your home directory on your VM.
</p></li><li><p>Each student has <code>sudo</code> access to their VM.  This makes it
    possible for the student to install any other required software.
</p></li><li><p>Imperative that students set up <strong>GUI access</strong> to their VM as that
    will be needed for subsequent projects.  The recommended software
    is x2go.
</p></li></ul></section><section data-level="h2"><h2>Catalog Description</h2><p><em>An in-depth understanding of programming for the World Wide Web:
